# Tribute to Jess of the Shire's Conspiracy Diagram – Discworld Visualization Project

This project is a digital tribute to **Jess of the Shire** and her extraordinary *Discworld Conspiracy Diagram*, which visualizes the intricate relationships, subseries, and character arcs across Terry Pratchett’s beloved *Discworld* universe.

Jess’s original hand-crafted visualization is a remarkable piece of literary cartography, and this project aims to honor and expand upon it through interactive, web-based representations.
